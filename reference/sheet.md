Attempt to start with a microservice application on your cloud native journey if you can. You can try an existing or monolithic application if this makes sense, as this will flush out tooling and dependencies you'll have for your journey to cloud native. kubectl, network connectivity etc. You're beyond minikube.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | By choosing the serverless route, here is a working model for the path. You may adapt this to your model.<br><br>Business needs to be sitting down and reviewing microservice patterns and architecture. Looking to understand the specifics for applications. Non-functional requirements such latency, resilience, scaling and third party tooling. If you're transforming a monolith this may impose significant redesign on the application as existing needs may not have the technical resources available. Try to ensure that the knowledge stay with the code - make sure an existing developer familiar with the code participates in its migration to cloud. Minimise divergence between cloud and your existing estate.

| Business outcomes                  | Deciding to adopt a cloud native approach to your application or services is usually driven by business reasons. You should have documentation as to what your business goals are and how cloud native helps you achieve those. Some examples may include:<br><br>Scale to 1 million users: Provide flexible, scalable infrastructure based on users at any given time equipped with fast failover in the event of a problem.<br>Deliver exceptional customer experience: Ensure the app is reliable as to not frustrate users<br>Get features to market faster: Enable a microservices approach to building apps. Smaller teams are more agile because each team has a focused function. APIs minimize the amount of cross-team communication required to build and deploy. | You have completed a successful POC. Based on the POC, you should have initial findings on how cloud native will help improve your app. In a dev environment, you could, for example, have seen that:<br>An app is using less resources (cost savings / more efficient use)<br>A new feature shipped faster (faster time to market and thus increased revenue)<br>There was no downtime (improved reliability for customers)<br><br><br>These are just examples, they are not a guarantee based on your environment.<br>Results may vary<br><br><br>                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | You should use your documented business goals to track progress, but remember it won't be immediate on day 1. Business outcomes may include:<br>Reduced spend on app infrastructure<br>Reduced team focus on app infrastructure (note: this will happen over time in this phase as the team gets more confident in their skills)<br>Increased security for the application<br>Improve compliance as you can restrict and track access to the application<br>Accelerated development life cycles as you implement CI/CD pipelines and thus get features to customers faster<br><br>In this phase, it’s important that the business outcomes are examined and explained to business stakeholders. It should be a discussion with engineering leadership, the application owner (finance, marketing, etc), the CEO, and even the board. Without these discussions and alignment, maturing to the next phases will come with little appreciation and possibly even skepticism.<br> | Up to this point, your teams have been focusing on learning cloud native. In this stage, your business outcomes are dependent on your team’s experience. As the team builds confidence, their competency around security, efficiency and reliability grows and they will implement defined processes for scale. All of these will impact your services and applications as the team improves.<br><br>Your team may have to revisit some decisions made earlier as cloud native technologies were rolled out. That could set you back slightly, but the goal is to ensure there is no missing functionality, no single point of failure or disappointing performance.<br><br>Monitoring is implemented. This will help the business get reports on what’s working and what isn't working. While the monitoring may be very specific, it will also provide insights into:<br>Resource utilization to control costs<br>Performance to ensure availability<br> | Your team as cloud native confidence. Now it’s time to take that knowledge and apply it more thoroughly to your business goals.<br><br>Your team will be able to focus on your business instead of maintaining Kubernetes.<br><br>Alignment on goals. If goal was security, you will spend time on this for example. If it was to increase speed of development, you will ship faster.<br><br>You will have measurement of what you've put in place. This is important as it will be used to demonstrate business outcomes. The business should expect to see:<br>Established protocols and procedures<br>Policy enforcement of compliance standards<br>Comparison of cloud native apps vs. non-cloud native<br><br>The business should expect more reporting in this phase. Reporting should cover compliance, security, performance and cost. These should be easily aligned to the business goals established in phase one.<br><br>For some, at this point, you may start to migrate your other applications and have a better understanding of what you want to achieve. | You should have achieved your business outcomes. You should have measurable results to show your leadership teams from the CEO to the CFO and the board.<br><br>You will continue to optimize your workloads against further/more advanced cost and performance metrics. You will never stop optimizing your cloud native infrastructure and apps. Here the expected business outcome is the ability to track how optimization continues to move the bar against established goals.<br><br>You may also revisit your goals at this point, adjusting them to what has been achieved and what you want to achieve in future.<br><br>You’ll automate as much as possible according to cloud native best practices to remove human error as to avoid security and performance problems. |
